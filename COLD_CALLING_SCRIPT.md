# Ultra-Direct Script for Busy Contractors

## Text-First Approach (RECOMMENDED)

### **Text Message (No Introduction Needed):**
```
[Company Name] - I built you a website:
[company-name].netlify.app

Calling in 2 minutes.
```

### **Follow-Up Call (10 seconds max):**
*"Did you see it? $800 and you keep it. Yes or no?"*

---

## If You Must Cold Call First:

### **Opening (3 seconds):**
*"[Name]? I built you a website. Want to see it?"*

**They'll ask "Who is this?" or "How much?"**

*"I'm texting the link now. It's $800. Look at it first."*

## After They See The Website (5 seconds)
*"Looks good, right? $800 and it stays up forever. Deal?"*

## If They Hesitate:
*"It's built. Your name's on it. Take it or I give it to another roofer."*

## Netlify Domain Strategy:
**Don't mention custom domains unless they ask!**
- Most contractors won't care about domains
- `johnsonroofing.netlify.app` looks professional enough
- Saves you time and money
- If they want custom domain, charge extra $200

## Ultra-Quick Objection Responses:

**"I don't need a website"** → *"Your customers do."*
**"I need to think about it"** → *"Nothing to think about. It's done."*
**"Who are you?"** → *"Guy who built your website. Want it or not?"*
**"I'm not tech-savvy"** → *"You don't do anything. I handle it."*

## Payment:
*"$800. Venmo, Zelle, or card? It stays live forever."*

## If They Say Yes:
*"Texting you payment info. Website stays up as long as you want."*

## Key Success Principles

**1. Lead with the demo** - Don't sell, show
**2. Keep it simple** - $800, professional website, 24 hours
**3. Focus on competition** - "Look better than other contractors"
**4. Handle objections confidently** - You've heard them all
**5. Close assumptively** - "When should we get this live?"

## Daily Targets
- **50 calls = 5-10 conversations = 1-2 sales = $800-1600/day**
- **Work 4 hours calling, 2 hours building/delivering**
- **Goal: $4000+/week**

## Pro Tips
- Call during business hours (8am-5pm)
- Have the demo site loaded and ready
- Sound confident and professional
- Use their company name frequently
- Create urgency: "I'm only taking 3 new clients this week"

**Remember: You're not selling a website, you're selling credibility and competitive advantage!**
