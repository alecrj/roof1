# Professional Cold Calling Script

## Text-First Strategy Analysis:

**YES, text-first absolutely works!** Here's why:
- Contractors are hands-on people who respond to visual proof
- Texts get read (98% open rate vs 2% cold calls)
- Shows initiative and builds immediate credibility
- Less intrusive than cold calling

## Cold Calling Script (If calling after text):

### **Opening:**
*"Hi [Name], this is Alec. I sent you a text about the website I built for [Company Name]. Did you get a chance to check it out?"*

### **If they saw it:**
*"What did you think? Pretty clean, right? I specialize in helping local contractors like yourself get more visibility online."*

### **If they didn't see it:**
*"No worries, I can resend it. Basically, I noticed you guys have great reviews but no website, so I put together a professional site to show what that could look like for your business."*

## Value Proposition:
*"Here's the thing - you're already successful, but you're missing out on customers who research online before calling. This gives them somewhere to go to see you're the real deal."*

## Pricing Discussion:
*"If you like what you see, it's $800 to make it yours. That includes hosting, mobile optimization, everything. Most web designers charge 2-3x that and take months to deliver."*

## Addressing Hesitation:
*"I get it - you probably don't think about websites much. But your customers do. When they Google your company name, this is what they'd see instead of just a basic listing."*

## Professional Close:
*"Look, I built it because I could see you run a quality business. If you want it, great. If not, no hard feelings. What do you think?"*

## Objection Handling:

**"I don't need a website"**
*"I understand - you're busy running the business. But think about it this way: when someone refers you, what's the first thing people do? They Google your company name. This just makes sure they find something professional."*

**"How do I know you're legit?"**
*"Fair question. I've built websites for contractors across Florida. Happy to show you examples or put you in touch with references. I'm local and this is what I do full-time."*

**"I need to think about it"**
*"Absolutely, it's a business decision. The website will be sitting there either way. Want me to follow up with you next week?"*

**"Can you make changes if I don't like something?"**
*"Of course. I include basic updates and can customize anything you want. The goal is to make you happy with it."*

## Next Steps:
*"Perfect! I'll get everything set up and send you the payment details. You'll have the live website within 24 hours. Sound good?"*

## Key Success Principles

**1. Lead with the demo** - Don't sell, show
**2. Keep it simple** - $800, professional website, 24 hours
**3. Focus on competition** - "Look better than other contractors"
**4. Handle objections confidently** - You've heard them all
**5. Close assumptively** - "When should we get this live?"

## Daily Targets
- **50 calls = 5-10 conversations = 1-2 sales = $800-1600/day**
- **Work 4 hours calling, 2 hours building/delivering**
- **Goal: $4000+/week**

## Pro Tips
- Call during business hours (8am-5pm)
- Have the demo site loaded and ready
- Sound confident and professional
- Use their company name frequently
- Create urgency: "I'm only taking 3 new clients this week"

**Remember: You're not selling a website, you're selling credibility and competitive advantage!**
