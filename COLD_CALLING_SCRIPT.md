# Cold Calling Script for $800 Websites

## Opening (10 seconds to hook them)
*"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I was looking on Google for local roofing contractors and found your Google Business profile. I noticed you don't have a website, so I actually went ahead and built one for you to show you what it could look like. Can I send you the link real quick?"*

**If they seem interested:** *"Great! I'm texting you the link right now. It's got your company name and everything - take a look."*

**If they're hesitant:** *"I know this sounds weird, but I do this for contractors who have great Google reviews but no website. It takes 30 seconds to look at - what's your cell number?"*

## The Demo Hook (30 seconds)
*"Okay, you should have the link now - it's got [Company Name] right at the top. Are you looking at it?"*

*"So I took your Google Business info and built this professional website around it. See how clean and professional this looks compared to having no website at all?"*

**Key Demo Points:**
1. *"This is what customers see when they Google your company name now vs. just your basic Google listing"*
2. *"Check it out on your phone too - it looks perfect on mobile where most customers will see it"*
3. *"I put in some sample project photos, but obviously we'd use your actual work"*
4. *"See how easy it is for customers to call you? That's the whole point"*

## Value Proposition (45 seconds)
*"Here's the thing - you've got great reviews on Google, but when people want to learn more about you, there's nowhere to send them. This website changes that completely:*
- *Now when someone Googles '[Company Name]', they see a professional website*
- *Customers can see your work, read about your experience, and contact you easily*
- *You look like the established, premium contractor vs. guys with no online presence*
- *It works 24/7 even when you're not answering your phone*

*I already did the work - it's sitting there ready to go live for you."*

## Address Common Objections

**"I don't need a website"**
*"Look, I can see from your Google reviews that you do great work and customers love you. But when they Google your company name, what do they find? Just a basic Google listing. This gives them somewhere to go to actually learn about your company and see your professionalism."*

**"How much does this cost?"**
*"Here's the thing - I already built it. The website is done. All I need to do is make it live with your domain name. The investment is $800 total. Compare that to hiring a web designer who'll charge you $2000+ and take 2-3 months."*

**"I need to think about it"**
*"I understand, but think about this - the website exists right now. I can have it live under your company name by tomorrow. Every day you wait is another day customers are Googling you and finding basically nothing. What's to think about?"*

**"Why did you build this without asking?"**
*"Because I could see you have a solid business with good reviews, but no web presence. I do this for a few select contractors each month. The website's already done - makes sense to use it, right?"*

**"I'm not tech-savvy"**
*"Perfect - that's exactly why I do this. You don't touch anything technical. I handle the domain, hosting, everything. You just tell customers to visit your website and watch them be impressed."*

## The Close
*"Look, the hard work is done - the website exists and looks great. I can have it live under [CompanyName].com by tomorrow. The investment is $800 total, and honestly, this will pay for itself with the first customer who finds you online instead of your competitor. Should I get this live for you?"*

**If they hesitate:**
*"Let me ask you this - if a potential customer Googles both you and your competitor, and you have a professional website while they don't, who do you think gets the call? The website is already built - we're just making it official."*

**Alternative close:**
*"I'll tell you what - I only do this for 2-3 contractors per month because I want to give each one personal attention. I can hold this website for [Company Name] until Friday, but after that I'll offer it to another roofer in the area. Fair enough?"*

## Closing Questions
- *"What's the best email to send you the details?"*
- *"Do you prefer to pay by check or card when it's ready?"*
- *"Any specific photos of your work you want featured?"*

## Money Collection
*"Perfect! I'll need $400 to get started today, and the remaining $400 when the site goes live tomorrow. That work for you?"*

**Payment Options:**
- Venmo/Zelle for speed
- Check if local
- Card over phone

## Follow-up Commitments
*"Great! You'll get:*
- *Website live in 24 hours*
- *Text with the live link when ready*
- *Simple instructions if you ever need changes*
- *My number for any questions*

*Sound good? Let's make [Company Name] look like the premium contractor you are."*
